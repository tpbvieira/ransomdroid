## Ransonware detection through behavioral analysis for Android

Ransondroid is an evaluation of [Eigensim](https://github.com/tpbvieira/eigensim) for ransomware detection on android devices. Eigensim is a framework composed by novel algorithms based on Model Order Selection (MOS) and Eigenvalue/Eigenvector similarity for behavioral anomaly detection. 

We evaluate feature engineering and [Eigensim](https://github.com/tpbvieira/eigensim) for behavioral analysis in order to detect ransomware attacks in Android devices, considering the required processing power for mobile devices and the feasibility of the proposed approach for devices with limited resources. 

The results are available in [our published paper](https://lasp.unb.br/wp-content/uploads/papers/Mobile_Netw_App_Thiago.pdf).
